Creating Tableau-ish Dashboard on Streamlit
https://lnkd.in/d4gh23Kb

When we think about Dashboard, it usually comes to Power BI or Tableau. But Streamlit, a Python library, can also be used to display data in texts, charts and/or tables as interactive as Tableau. It has various functions that enables us to build and format our dashboard in form of a web app, and all that done using python codes. In this example, I made an analysis of apartment rents available in Berlin, as seen in https://www.immowelt.de. It consists of a full-round of data analytics tasks, including:

1. web scraping using beautifulsoup to get rent costs, number of rooms, addresses, and apartment features (balcony, shower, bathtub, parking space, garden, type of floor, etc.)
2. data cleaning and EDA in python using pandas
3. building machine learning model(s) to do supervised learning to predict rents based on the apartment features mentioned above
4. displaying bar charts, line charts, choropleth map using plotly
5. setting up the dashboard in streamlit, along with the tableau-ish filters to select specific rows and/or features of the dataset, and display the data on real-time updated charts, that keeps changing upon changes on the filters

Try to get the highest prediction score on the "prediction" section. You can optimize the Parameters, but it might take hours. Have fun with the web app ðŸ˜‰
